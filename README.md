## hi, i'm mark

I am a Research Software Scientist for [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), as part of which I develop open-source tools to automatically analyse and assess software.
These include

- [`pkgcheck`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck) to implement an array of checks on R packages.
- [`pkgstats`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats) to extract code statistics from every R package ever.
- [`autotest`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/autotest) to automatically test R packages by mutating inputs.

### Urban Analyst

I am also the lead developer of the open-source [Urban Analyst platform](https://urbananalyst.city), which aims to "*Analyse and compare cities across the world*".
See the pinned repositories below for some of the software that powers that platform.

### What and how i code

Most of my code is bundled as R packages, with a lot of that written in C++ or C.
I do everything in vim + tmux, via my [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/mpadge/dotfiles)

### Anything else?

I've got an intermittently updated [blog](https://mpadge.github.io), ~~and make intermittent noises on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bikesRdata).~~
