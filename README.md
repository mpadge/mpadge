## hi, i'm mark

I am a Research Software Scientist for [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), as part of which I develop open-source tools to automatically analyse and asssess software.
These include

- [`packgraph`](https://github.com/mpadge/packgraph) to examine and analyse function call graphs
- [`pkgreport`](https://github.com/mpadge/pkgreport) to serve a callable API which returns a formatted report on code structure and function, intended to serve as a template for software review
- [`autotest`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/autotest) to automatically test R packages by throwing inputs of various forms and structures at software functions.

### Active Transport Futures

I am also a lead developer for Active Tranport Futures, an organisation dedicated to developing open-source software using open data to plan urban futures in which active transport plays an increasingly prominent role. See the pinned repositories below for some of that software.

### What and how i code

Most of my code is bundled as R packages, with a lot of that written in C++ or C.
I do everything in vim + tmux, via my [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/mpadge/dotfiles)

### Anything else?

I've got an intermittently updated [blog](https://mpadge.github.io), and make intermittent noises on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bikesRdata).
