## hi, i'm mark

I am a Research Software Scientist for [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org). I
develop and maintain the open-source tools used to automatically analyse and
assess software. These include

- [`pkgcheck`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck) to implement an array of checks on R packages.
- [`pkgstats`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats) to extract code statistics from every R package ever.
- [`autotest`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/autotest) to automatically test R packages by mutating inputs.
- [`pkgmatch`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgmatch) to match packages against other packages or text descriptions.

### Urban Analyst

I also develop the open-source [Urban Analyst platform](https://urbananalyst.city), which aims to "*Analyse and compare cities across the world*".
See the pinned repositories below for some of the software that powers that platform.

### What and how i code

A lot of my code is bundled as R packages, with a lot of that written in C++ or
C. Urban Analyst is Typescript and Rust. I do everything in neovim + tmux, via
my [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/mpadge/dotfiles)
